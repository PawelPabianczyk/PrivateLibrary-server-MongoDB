# PrivateLibrary-server
PrivateLibrary is a final application for a JAVA programming subject at my university. The goal was to create a desktop application that would allow the user to manage his own library. To use the application, the user must register and log in. The app allows you to add books, authors, publishers and genres. In addition, it provides the ability to view books added by other users.
